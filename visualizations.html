                           The visualization uses boxplot to compare purchases amounts between two incentive groups: customers who used a discount/promo and customers who used neither. The marks are rectangular boxes, median lines, and the whiskers represent the distribution of values.
The channels are  position on the y-axis that shows purchase amount, position on the x-axis that separates incentive groups, the length of the box encodes the IQR (variability), and the line inside the box shows the median, and the whiskers indicate the full range of values.

                        <p>
                           The visualization shows that the purchase amounts for the two incentive types are mostly similar, but there are some small differences. Customers who used a Discount/Promo spent slightly more on average ($61.94) than those who Used Neither ($59.89). The spending for discounted customers was more consistent with a smaller standard deviation of $22.18 (compared to $23.79). The range of spending for those who used a discount was $74.0, while for the non-incentivized group it was slightly larger at $79.0.                             Overall, the visualization shows that while incentives slightly encourage higher and more consistent spending, the purchasing behavior remains similar for both groups. Therefore, the presence of an incentive has a small positive effect but is not the primary factor driving very high or very low purchase amounts.

                This stacked bar chart visualizes total purchase amounts segmented by gender and age group in Massachusetts. The chart  chart uses bars as its marks. The channels include position along the x-axis to distinguish between gender categories (Male and Female), and length or position along the y-axis to encode total purchase amount in USD. There is also a color channel to differentiate between age groups.

            <p>
                This figure shows spending patterns across different demographics in Massachusetts, showing how purchase behavior varies by gender and age group. Men consistently outspend women across every age category. The highest spending demographic is men aged 61-70, while women aged 51-60 represent the lowest spending group.

                            The visualization uses a treemap to show how size counts are distributed within each product category. The marks are nested rectangles that represent categories and sizes.
The channels are the area of each rectangle shows the number of purchases for each size, color distinguishes the product categories, and text labels identify the sizes within each section.

                          The visualization shows how different product categories in Massachusetts distribute their sales across sales. Clothing has the highest volume overall, with Medium and Small being the most common sizes. Accessories and Footwear also show stronger demand for Medium and Large, while Small is much less frequent in Footwear. Outerwear has the lowest volume but shows a more even spread across sizes. Overall, the treemap highlights that Medium is consistently the most popular size across categories, followed by Large and then Small, helping identify which sizes should be prioritized when stocking inventory.
