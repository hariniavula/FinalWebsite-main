                <h2>Key Insights</h2>
                <p>
                    Our analysis of shopping behavior reveals three critical insights for targeting the right customers and managing inventory effectively in Massachusetts.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Finding 1: Target Demographics</h3>
                <p>
                    Massachusetts stands out in the Northeast region with customers who spend around $61 per purchase and shop consistently throughout the year. Men spend more than women across all age groups, and spending increases with age, peaking at ages 61-70. This means premium products and targeted promotions should focus on older male shoppers, while discounts can help engage younger customers and women.
                </p>

                <h3>Finding 2: Seasonal Shifts around Product Demand</h3>
                <p>
                    Clothing dominates year-round, especially in winter. But Accessories increase in summer (32% of purchases), and in fall, Accessories and Footwear become equally important as Clothing. Medium sizes are most popular across all categories. Retailers should stock Clothing heavily all year but increase Accessories for summer/fall and prioritize Medium sizes. Marketing campaigns should seasonally promote Accessories during summer and  both Accessories and Footwear in fall to match customer demand patterns.
                </p>

                <h3>Finding 3: Discounts Work, But Aren't Everything</h3>
                <p>
                    Customers using discounts spend slightly more ($62 vs $60) and more consistently. While the impact is not huge, promotions do encourage higher spending. This makes discounts useful for attracting price-sensitive shoppers, especially younger customers and women, but they shouldn't be the only strategy for driving sales.

                <h2>Future Work</h2>
                
                <h3>Idea #1</h3>
                <p>
                   While our current analysis focuses primarily on Massachusetts, future work could expand the scope to compare trends across different U.S. regions. Since the dataset includes customers from all states, analyzing regional differences in spending, seasonal product preferences, and incentive usage would provide a more complete understanding of national shopping behavior. For example, we could examine how purchase amounts vary between the Northeast, South, Midwest, and West, or whether certain categories perform better in specific climates or regions. 

                <h3>Idea #2</h3>
                <p>
                   We could use use predictive models to take the analysis beyond basic visual patterns. By using features like age, gender, location, purchase history, and incentive use, we could predict things such as purchase amount, preferred product categories, or whether someone is likely to use a discount. We could also use clustering to discover new types of shopper groups that aren’t visible from simple demographic charts. Combining customer details with product information would also make it possible to forecast which categories or sizes will be most popular in different seasons. Overall, this type of modeling would turn our insights into more practical recommendations for inventory planning and personalized marketing.
