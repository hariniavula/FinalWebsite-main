### Core Purpose

The goal was to transform a Kaggle e-commerce shopping dataset into clear, actionable business strategies by analyzing customer behavior in **Massachusetts**.

The analysis focused on four key goals:
* **Spending Dynamics:** Comparing Massachusetts spending to other states and identifying high-value categories.
* **Promotion Efficacy:** Determining how discounts affect customer spending and consistency.
* **Product Optimization:** Pinpointing the most popular product sizes for better inventory planning.
* **Targeted Marketing:** Analyzing age and gender correlations with shopping frequency for customer segmentation.

### Visualization Tools and Techniques

The project applied data cleaning, visualization best practices, and effective data storytelling using multiple tools: **Pandas**, **Altair**, and **D3.js**.

| Visualization | Description & Interactivity | Visualization Technique |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **US States' Purchasing Amounts** | Average purchase amount per state, encoded by color intensity (darker blue). | **Choropleth Map** (with hover tooltips and a region filter). |
| **Purchases by Category & Season** | Number of purchases comparing Product Categories (Y-axis) against Seasons (X-axis). | **Heatmap** (with color intensity encoding purchase count and hover interactivity). |
| **Incentives and Promos on Purchasing Amount** | Distribution of Purchase Amounts between discount users and non-users. | **Boxplot** (visually representing median, IQR, and variability). |
| **Purchase Amount by Gender & Age Group** | Total purchase amounts by gender in Massachusetts. | **Bar Chart** (featuring a continuous age slider for dynamic cumulative viewing). |
| **Size Distribution by Category** | Purchase counts for various sizes nested within each product category. | **Treemap** (where area encodes purchase count and color distinguishes category). |

### What I Learned

The project reinforced the importance of shaping a clear narrative before visualization. It provided hands-on experience in using Pandas for data organization, Altair/D3 for building clear charts, and the power of **interactivity** (filters, hover highlights, sliders) to enhance the viewer's experience and allow for independent data exploration.
